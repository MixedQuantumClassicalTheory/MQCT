# MQCT v20_21

## NOTE:

This Branch **v20_21_beta** is an ongoing development project for an approximate method within MQCT framework. For description (including an User Manual) of the first release, please refer to the **Master** directory.

## Description of AT-MQCT:

In this method, the classical-like equations of motion for the translational degrees of freedom (scattering) are decoupled from the quantum-like equations for time-evolution of the internal molecular states (rotational, vibrational). In practice, trajectories are pre-computed during the first step of calculations, with driving forces determined solely by the potential energy surface of the entrance channel, which is an adiabatic trajectory approximation. Quantum state-to-state transition probabilities are computed during the second step of calculations, with an expanded basis and very efficient step-size adjustment. Application of this method to H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub> rotationally inelastic scattering is published in recent article [AT-MQCT](./AT_MQCT.pdf)
